# Random-Github-pfp
An extremely simple script that takes a random image uploaded to a profile picture of a completely random profile and shows it to us!
I got this idea when I found a similar site but with random images from Imgur. I found it interesting, and decided to make a similar one, but with profile pictures of github's profiles!<br>

I censored our friend's face here, but the screenshot above shows how the interface works.
